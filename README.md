Square root - Design a square rooting machine findSqrt which takes an unsigned number n, 0 ≤ n ≤ 255, through a set of toggle                 switches, computes z = √n by computing the sum 1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + 2 × k − 1= k^2 and displays z.

Radix 4 Booth - Construction of an 8-bit radix-4 Booth's multiplier.

CPU design -    Construction of 16 bit Multi-Cycle CPU which execute Mips instruction. It supports various addressing modes                   such as immediate, register, base and indirect. Extended Multi-Cycle CPU to Single Cycle CPU.
